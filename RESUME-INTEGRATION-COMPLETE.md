# Resume Site Integration - Complete ✅

Your resume site (https://srikar-cv.vercel.app/en) has been successfully integrated into your portfolio as both a **project showcase** and a **utility link**.

## What Was Added

### 1. New Project Page 📄
- **File**: `srikar-cv.html`
- **Route**: `/srikar-cv`
- Showcases your resume site as a portfolio piece
- Highlights the technical decisions: Vue.js, Swiss design, PDF generation
- Follows the same design pattern as your other project pages

### 2. Work Slider Integration 🎞️
- **Updated**: `script/slides.js`
- Your resume now appears in the work carousel (position 2 of 5)
- Users can scroll through and discover it alongside other projects

### 3. Utility Links 🔗
Added quick-access resume links in:
- **About page footer** - "Resume ↗" in the Explore section
- **Contact page bottom bar** - "Resume" alongside social links
- Both open your live resume site in a new tab

### 4. Build Configuration ⚙️
Updated:
- `vite.config.js` - Added srikar-cv to build inputs
- `vercel.json` - Added URL rewrite for clean routing

## What You Need To Do

### 📸 Add Screenshots
The integration is **99% complete**, but you need to add 4 screenshots of your resume site.

**Required images** (place in `/public/gallery-images/`):

1. **srikar-cv-hero.png** - Full page hero shot for work slider
2. **srikar-cv-page1.png** - Desktop view of top section
3. **srikar-cv-page2.png** - Desktop view of experience/skills
4. **srikar-cv-page3.png** - Mobile responsive view

See `public/gallery-images/SRIKAR-CV-IMAGES-NEEDED.md` for detailed instructions.

### 🧪 Test It Out
Once images are added:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Then visit:
- **Work page**: `/work` - Scroll to see your resume in the carousel
- **Resume project page**: `/srikar-cv` - See the full project showcase
- **About page**: Scroll to footer, find "Resume ↗" link
- **Contact page**: See "Resume" in bottom social bar

### 🚀 Deploy
When ready:

```bash
npm run build
git add .
git commit -m "Add interactive resume as portfolio project"
git push
```

Vercel will automatically deploy the updates.
